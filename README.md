# Student-Performance-Analysis
 This work analyzes educational data using various machine learning techniques. It starts by preprocessing the
data, then selects the most relevant features. Finally, it trains and evaluates three classification models:
Logistic Regression, SVM, and a Neural Network, comparing their performance to identify the best model for
predicting student outcomes.
